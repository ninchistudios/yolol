# Chaga Design Goals

The Chaga is intended as an upgrade to the Momento, solving its main problems while maintaining its design language and strengths.

The intent is that it's a "print and go" design, which will not require any modding to make it ready for a small group danger zone excursion.

## Preserved

* The Momento is fast and moddable. The Chaga preserves the 150m/s empty speed, and approx 120m/s full speed with safezone ores, in an open and moddable framework.
* XY form factor with a central open bay. Unlike the more common "flat" XZ form factor, the Chaga preserves the Momento's "vertical" XY with an open central section.

## Fixes

* Plumbing. The Momento suffers from single point of failure plumbing, with exposed wires everywhere. The Chaga is primarily ducted, with quad-redundant main duct buses and at least double redundant plumbing to essential components with no hidden plumbing. 
* Accessibility. The Momento appears to be auto-bolted, which makes accessing certain components very difficult. The Chaga is entirely manually bolted, and every key component can be easily accessed and maintained.
* Resilience. Key flight components of the Momento are exposed and under-attached, making them easily damaged rendering the ship adrift. The Chaga houses key components in armoured enclosures and bolts the heck out of them.
* The Momento feels like a ship that was designed but never flown. The Chaga is being flown as my main ship during development, so any quality of life problems become apparent and can be fixed.
* Programming. As a CA design, the YOLOL chips provided with the Momento are out of date. The Chaga includes:
  * Early Access compatible ISAN 2 Quad navigation with Velocity display
  * Custom Generator management
  * Custom Analyser display
  * TODO
  
## Upgrades

* Refined cockpit
* RCS-only maneuvering mode for delicate mining ops
* Material Analyser
* Relocated hardpoints to improve cockpit access
* Group-compatible with Tailgunner and Mining Operator seats
* TODO
